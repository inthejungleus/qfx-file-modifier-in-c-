# qfx-file-modifier-in-c++

This is my original C++ parser of the qfx (variant of .ofx) format file.  It was made to rip out the visa transaction idetification number from the beginning of visa debit card transactions.  The visa transaction number prevented retailers of the same name from being categoriezed and reported together because each visa transaction number made each retailer with the same name a completely different retailer.  I created this command c++ line program to save me the trouble of manually removing each of these transaction numbers when I imported the data into Quicken Essentials for Mac.  

I see this code as hard for others to read (I apologize!) because of the heavy use of pointers.  It was an excercise in utilizing c++ pointers. Also this was for first foray into C++ as a personal project, which was actually completed in 2011, despite it being committed to github lateer in around 2015. As such it borrows heavily fom C syntax instead of modern C++, such as using char arrays instead of std strings to make use of character pointers for the main parser.
